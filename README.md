# predictive-maintenance-project
This project uses AI to predict machine failure in a factory. It analyzes sensor data like temperature and speed to find patterns. Using a Random Forest Classifier, the model identifies potential issues before they cause costly downtime, improving efficiency and preventing unexpected breakdowns.
